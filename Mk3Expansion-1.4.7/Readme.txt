OVERVIEW
===================================================================================================================
This pack provides mew mk3 spaceplane parts in the form of engines, fuselage segments and aerodynamic accessories.

---This is a Work In Progress---
Everything is functional, but things like IVAs are not fully implemented, and part cost/mass/tech tree location is not finalized.

A note on the truncated fuselage entension: These are asymmetric parts, and due to the way KSP handles symmetry, at present these parts need to be manually mirrored on craft, the Editor symmetry doen't work.

INSTALLATION
===================================================================================================================
Place the GameData/Mk3Expansion folder in your Kerbal Space Program/GameData folder
